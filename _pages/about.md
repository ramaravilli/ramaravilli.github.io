I am currently a **Software Engineer at Visa** in Bangalore, where I work on building resilient financial systems and applying machine learning to real-world challenges. My broader research interests lie in **Deep Learning** and **Trustworthy AI**, with a specific focus on **AI Safety**, explainability, and privacy-preserving machine learning.

Prior to my current role, I was an undergraduate research intern at the Institute for Development and Research in Banking Technology (**IDRBT**), where I was advised by [Prof. Ravi Vadlamani](https://www.idrbt.ac.in/dr-v-ravi/). During that time, I worked on deep reinforcement learning for financial forecasting and graph-based anomaly detection.
